      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The premise of this website is to inform readers of the dangers and safety measures of various chemicals and their effects on the body.

        Basically, this website would have a home page where a person could browse through different links to articles. Each article would have its own page dedicated to explaining information about one chemical. Each article would explain what that chemical is, what it does, its effects on the body, how to handle it, its potential uses, and what to do if one encounters or is exposed to it. 
        
        This website would be very simple, easy to navigate, and serve the purpose of educating its audience.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the home page is to more or less serve as a quick navigational page of the website. 
        This page will also introduce those who first come across it, giving a quick introduction to new readers. 
        On this page, there will be a featured article section, followed by a few recommended pages.

        Each of these links would have quick overviews to go along side them, just so that the reader can
        take a quick glance at what said article is about.

        will also have small icons go along side them.

      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>
        All of the site articles will be covering a specific chemical, but this article will be an exception to act as a guniea pig of sorts.
        Also, it will serve as a good introductory page, since everyone is already well accustomed to water. 
        This page will feature many different dangerous scenarios that can be encountered with water with relevant ways to deal with such scenarios.
